# Populations

**Populations network model**

Homo sapiens' civilization is a complex adaptive system. Although it is similar to the population of genetic systems, it more closely resembles the network of ecosystems forming the biosphere or a global computer network with its multitude of sub-networks. The author proposed a conceptual model of shaping the culture following the pattern of evolution and succession in biological ecosystems. Using a simulation implementation, he verified its consistency and adequacy both for the process of shaping culture in various environmental conditions and for the "vertical" process of transferring culture between generations.
